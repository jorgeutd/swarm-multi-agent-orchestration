# Swarm Multi-Agent Orchestration

This project demonstrates multi-agent orchestration using the Swarm framework developed by OpenAI. It showcases various agent-based solutions, leveraging cutting-edge technologies for effective agent communication and task management.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains implementation directories for different multi-agent strategies.
  - **contextual_rag/**: An example implementation of Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
  - **support_bot/**: An implementation of a support bot using Swarm and Qdrant.
- **examples/**: Contains example scripts and applications.
- **tests/**: Contains unit tests for the different implementations.

## Installation

Ensure you have the necessary Python version and dependencies. Follow these steps to set up the project:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run an example implementation, navigate to the respective directory and execute the main script. For example:

```bash
python src/contextual_rag/main.py
```

Or for the support bot:

```bash
python src/support_bot/main.py
```
